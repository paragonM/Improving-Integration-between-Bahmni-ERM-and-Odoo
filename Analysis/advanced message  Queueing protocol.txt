AMQP is a binary, application layer protocol, designed to efficiently support a wide variety of messaging applications and communication patterns. It provides flow controlled,[3] message-oriented communication with message-delivery guarantees such as at-most-once (where each message is delivered once or never), at-least-once (where each message is certain to be delivered, but may do so multiple times) and exactly-once (where the message will always certainly arrive and do so only once),[4] and authentication and/or encryption based on SASL and/or TLS.[5] It assumes an underlying reliable transport layer protocol such as Transmission Control Protocol (TCP).[6]
